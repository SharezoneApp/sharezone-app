///
/// Declare a top level [Serializers] field called serializers. Annotate it
/// with [SerializersFor] and provide a `const` `List` of types you want to
/// be serializable.
///
/// The built_value code generator will provide the implementation. It will
/// contain serializers for all the types asked for explicitly plus all the
/// types needed transitively via fields.
///
/// You usually only need to do this once per project.

/// As a Firestore Document returned by the Firestore/Firebase Plugin returns
/// with an DateTime Object and not with "just" data, it doesn't need to be converted
/// into a DateTime Object. So I've had to add an [TimestampDateTimeSerializer] for DateTime which
/// basically does nothing.
/// As the Firestore Plugin is only usable for flutter and not Web the problem is
/// that this !may! not work if the data has another form than returned of the
/// Firestore Plugin. But this should propably work even on the web. I hope ;)
///
/// see: https://github.com/google/built_value.dart/issues/454
///
/// Also the [StandardJsonPlugin] is used as a Firestore, so maps returned
/// by Firestore are usable and not converted/used as lists, which throws an error.
