# Here quick crash course about the glob pattern:\
# When we have "**/homework/**" returns this always true, if in the path of file
# a directory "homework" contains:\
# "app/lib/homework/add.dart" -> true\
# "app/lib/timetable/add.dart" -> false
#
# When we have "**/**homework**" returns this always true, if a file contains
# the word "homework":\
# "app/lib/homework_add.dart" -> true\
# "app/lib/fab_homework_button.dart" -> true\
# "app/lib/homeworks_page.dart" -> true\
# "app/lib/homewor_page.dart" -> false\
#
# Try this the following link to play around with the glob pattern:
# https://globster.xyz/?q=**%2F**homework**&f=app%2Flib%2Fhomework_page.dart%2Capp%2Flib%2Ftimetable_page.dart%2Capp%2Flib%2Fhomework%2Fadd.dart&embed=1
