  # We are building for every PR a web preview, which will be deployed to
  # Firebase Hosting. The link to the website will posted as comment (like:
  # https://github.com/SharezoneApp/sharezone-app/pull/119#issuecomment-1030012299).
  #
  # The previews are helping reviewer and other users to quickly view the
  # changes in a compiled version.
  #
  # A link to a preview expires after 7 days.
  #
  # Required steps to set this up:
  # 1. Run "firebase init hosting:github"
  # 2. Enable "Firebase Hosting API" in Google Cloud project
  # 3. Write GitHub action job
  # 4. Adjust website restrictions for Firebase Key "Sharezone Web Key".
