[Sharezone](https://sharezone.net) is a collaborative school organization app for iOS, Android, macOS and web.\
With Sharezone pupils, teachers and even parents can organize homework, files, timetables, events, information sheets and more together.  

Sharezone is currently only available in German.  
We might expand to more languages and regions in the future üåçüöÄ
