      #  * We can use a Linux runner instead of a macOS runner in
      #    Github Actions (macOS runner is required for using an Android emulator).
      #  * We can run the tests on a real device instead of an emulator.

      #  * Increases the speed of the CI by 10 minutes (compared to running the
      #    tests on a macOS runner).
