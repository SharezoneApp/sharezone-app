    // This was implemented before that if we force-closed a currently read
    // section and scrolled out of it that we would update the [ExpansionMode]
    // to [ExpansionMode.automatic] again.
    // This had the problem that if we come from a "no section read" state (e.g.
    // this is the first section) that a force-closed section wouldn't open
    // since we have never scrolled out of it (currently reading wasn't updated
    // before we entered this section).

    //
    // 1. were and still are in a force-closed section.
    //    It stays closed since else closing a currently read section and
    //    scrolling around in it would expand it again right away.
    //
    // 2. are in a forced open section which is ment to always stay open until
    //    a user closes it again manually.
    //
    // Altough this will also be the run if we scroll out of a forced-close
    // section since we update to the default auto-expand mode only if when we
    // enter the section again (see above).

    // We could also just return [partiallyUpdated] but this is more explicit.
