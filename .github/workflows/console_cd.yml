  # Since the console depends on the /lib folder, it could be that the console
  # requires a new deployment. In this case, the developer needs to trigger the
  # deployment manually or wait until the next change "console/**" is pushed. We
  # do this to avoid unnecessary deployments since a new deployment invalidates
  # the cache.
