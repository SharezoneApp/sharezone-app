# sharezone_localizations

**Sharezone Localizations** generates easily accessible translatable strings for the Sharezone-App. This package leverages Flutter's [Internationalization (i18n)](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization) features, providing an easy interface for adding, generating, and accessing localized strings in your application.

## Features

- Easy String Access: Access your translations using a simple extension (context.l10n).
- Multiple Locales: Support multiple languages via .arb files.
- Automatic Code Generation: Easily generate localization delegates and associated code using the flutter gen-l10n tool (or a dedicated VS Code Task).
- Locale Management:
  - `AppLocaleProvider` helps you access and manage the current locale in real time, allowing dynamic locale switching.
- Auto-translate with [arb_translate](https://pub.dev/packages/arb_translate): Use the arb_translate package to auto-translate your .arb files.

## Usage

### Accessing Localized Strings

After you have generated your localizations (see [Generating Localizations](#generating-localizations)), you can access the strings via the BuildContext extension:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sharezone_localizations/sharezone_localizations.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(context.l10n.common_actions_cancel),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(context.l10n.common_actions_cancel),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Where `common_actions_cancel` is the key from your .arb file (e.g., `app_en.arb`).  
Use it as `context.l10n.common_actions_cancel`.

To manage or observe locale changes:

- `AppLocaleProvider` can be injected in your widget tree to handle locale switching logic.

---

### How to Add/Update Strings

1. Open your `.arb` file for the corresponding locale (e.g., `l10n/app_en.arb` for English).
2. Add a new key-value pair. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "common_actions_cancel": "Cancel"
   }
   ```
3. (Optional) Add placeholders if needed:
   ```json
   {
     "welcome_message": "Hello, {userName}!",
     "@welcome_message": {
       "description": "A welcome message for the user",
       "placeholders": {
         "userName": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

This allows you to dynamically inject parameters (for example userName) into the string.

4. Repeat the above steps in each relevant .arb file (e.g., app_de.arb, app_es.arb, etc.) to keep translations up to date across your app. (Optionally you can use packages like arb_translate for auto translations)
5. We use `"@_COMMENT:" {}` as comments in the .arb files. This is a workaround because the .arb format does not support comments:
   ```json
   {
     "@_HOMEWORK": {},
     "homework_page_title": "Homework",
     "..."
   }
   ```

## Generating Localizations

After updating or creating .arb files, regenerate the localizations so Flutter can reflect the changes.

### Flutter Gen-L10n Command

Run inside this package:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

### Using VS Code Task

If you have a VS Code task called "Generate l10n for sharezone_localizations", you can:

1. Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P on macOS / Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows).
2. Select "Tasks: Run Task".
3. Choose "Generate l10n for sharezone_localizations".

This task runs `flutter gen-l10n` with your chosen configuration.

## Translating with arb_translate

With the [arb_translate](https://pub.dev/packages/arb_translate) package, you can auto-translate your .arb files using
Large Language Models (LLMs). We're going to use [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/). An LLM has the advantage that we can provide the model with context (what our application does, what the string is for, etc.), which can lead to better translations.

1. Install the arb_translate package:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate arb_translate
   ```

2. Generate your API key. You can create your Gemini key [here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
3. Save your API token in the environment variable `ARB_TRANSLATE_API_KEY`

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   export ARB_TRANSLATE_API_KEY='your-api-key'

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:ARB_TRANSLATE_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

4. Run the following command to translate your .arb files (from the `lib/sharezone_localizations` directory):

   ```bash
   arb_translate
   ```

5. Review and validate translations:

- Check the generated translations for accuracy
- Look for context-specific terms that might need manual adjustment
- Consider having native speakers review critical sections
- Override auto-translations as needed by updating the .arb files manually

6. Re-generate the localizations, see [Generating Localizations](#generating-localizations)
