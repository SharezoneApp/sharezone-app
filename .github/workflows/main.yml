  # changes in a compiled version.
  #
  # A link to a preview expires after 7 days.
  #
  # Required steps to set this up:
  # 1. Run "firebase init hosting:github"
  # 2. Enable "Firebase Hosting API" in Google Cloud project
  # 3. Write GitHub action job
  # 4. Adjust website restrictions for Firebase Key "Sharezone Web Key".
