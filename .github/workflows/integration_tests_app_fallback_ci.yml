# A workaround for GitHub Actions jobs that required and based on a path.
#
# Currently, it's not possible to set a GitHub Action to required which is
# based on path changes. The reason for this that the action is not executed
# when the action does not match the paths. Therefore, merging will be
# blocked.
#
# A workaround is to have a job which the same name.
