# Here quick crash course about the glob pattern:
# When we have "**/homework/**" returns this always true, if in the path of file
# a directory "homework" contains:
# "app/lib/homework/add.dart" -> true
# "app/lib/timetable/add.dart" -> false
#
# When we have "**/**homework**" returns this always true, if a file contains
# the word "homework":
# "app/lib/homework_add.dart" -> true
# "app/lib/fab_homework_button.dart" -> true
# "app/lib/homeworks_page.dart" -> true
# "app/lib/homewor_page.dart" -> false
#
# Try this the following link to play around with the glob pattern:
# https://globster.xyz/?q=**%2F**homework**&f=app%2Flib%2Fhomework_page.dart%2Capp%2Flib%2Ftimetable_page.dart%2Capp%2Flib%2Fhomework%2Fadd.dart&embed=1
#
# Another recommendation is to keep the global general and wide. For the
# "feature: homework" label, do not list all the paths to the homework
# directories. Instead, just use something like "**/homework/**". This will
# automatically include the app files, test files, package files and asset files
# that contain a homework directory. Of course, this can lead to false positives
# in a few cases. However, we prefer the general glob to the small chance of a
# false positive because we think the chance of not assigning the label with too
# specific globs is much higher than having a false positive with a general
# glob. And when searching for a PR with labels, it is usually better to find a
# few false positives than not to find a PR about a change in the homework
# feature that does not have the homework label.
