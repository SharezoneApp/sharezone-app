/// A widget to show/hide a [child] with a fade-in/fade-out.
///
/// Difference to:
/// * [Visibility] - hides only a [child] without an animation.
/// * [AnimatedOpacity] - only makes [child] transparent (can still be
///   interacted with)
/// * [AnimatedSwitcher] - can be used to hide/show children with a fade but
///   does not have the customizability of the [maintain...] parameters.
///
/// By default, the [visible] property controls whether the [child] is included
/// in the subtree or not; when it is not [visible], the [replacement] child
/// (typically a zero-sized box) is included instead.
///
/// A variety of flags can be used to tweak exactly how the child is hidden.
/// (Changing the flags dynamically is discouraged, as it can cause the [child]
/// subtree to be rebuilt, with any state in the subtree being discarded.
/// Typically, only the [visible] flag is changed dynamically.)
///
/// These widgets provide some of the facets of this one:
///
///  * [Opacity], which can stop its child from being painted.
///  * [Offstage], which can stop its child from being laid out or painted.
///  * [TickerMode], which can stop its child from being animated.
///  * [ExcludeSemantics], which can hide the child from accessibility tools.
///  * [IgnorePointer], which can disable touch interactions with the child.
///
/// Using this widget is not necessary to hide children. The simplest way to
/// hide a child is just to not include it, or, if a child _must_ be given (e.g.
/// because the parent is a [StatelessWidget]) then to use [SizedBox.shrink]
/// instead of the child that would otherwise be included.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [AnimatedSwitcher], which can fade from one child to the next as the
///    subtree changes.
///  * [AnimatedCrossFade], which can fade between two specific children.

  /// state that cannot be recreated on the fly.
  ///
  /// If this property is true, an [Offstage] widget is used to hide the child
  /// instead of replacing it with [replacement].
  ///
  /// If this property is false, then [maintainAnimation] must also be false.

  /// layout in time with an [AnimationController], and the result of that
  /// layout is being used to influence some other logic. If this flag is false,
  /// then any [AnimationController]s hosted inside the [child] subtree will be
  /// muted while the [visible] flag is false.

  /// If this property is false, then [maintainSize] must also be false.
