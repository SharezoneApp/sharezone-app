/// An immutable 32 bit color value in ARGB format.
///
/// Consider the light teal of the Flutter logo. It is fully opaque, with a red
/// channel value of 0x42 (66), a green channel value of 0xA5 (165), and a blue
/// channel value of 0xF5 (245). In the common "hash syntax" for color values,
/// it would be described as `#42A5F5`.
///
/// Here are some ways it could be constructed:
///
/// ```dart
/// Color c = const Color(0xFF42A5F5);
/// Color c = const Color.fromARGB(0xFF, 0x42, 0xA5, 0xF5);
/// Color c = const Color.fromARGB(255, 66, 165, 245);
/// Color c = const Color.fromRGBO(66, 165, 245, 1.0);
/// ```
///
/// If you are having a problem with `Color` wherein it seems your color is just
/// not painting, check to make sure you are specifying the full 8 hexadecimal
/// digits. If you only specify six, then the leading two digits are assumed to
/// be zero, which means fully-transparent:
///
/// ```dart
/// Color c1 = const Color(0xFFFFFF); // fully transparent white (invisible)
/// Color c2 = const Color(0xFFFFFFFF); // fully opaque white (visible)
/// ```

class Color {
  /// Construct a color from the lower 32 bits of an [int].
  ///
  /// The bits are interpreted as follows:
  ///
  /// * Bits 24-31 are the alpha value.
  /// * Bits 16-23 are the red value.
  /// * Bits 8-15 are the green value.
  /// * Bits 0-7 are the blue value.
  ///
  /// In other words, if AA is the alpha value in hex, RR the red value in hex,
  /// GG the green value in hex, and BB the blue value in hex, a color can be
  /// expressed as `const Color(0xAARRGGBB)`.
  ///
  /// For example, to get a fully opaque orange, you would use `const
  /// Color(0xFFFF9000)` (`FF` for the alpha, `FF` for the red, `90` for the
  /// green, and `00` for the blue).
