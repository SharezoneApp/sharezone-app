If you have ans questions, please join our [Discord](https://sharezone.net/discord).

## How to set up your development environment
If you would like to contribute to our code, please follow the introduction to set up your development environment.

### Operating system
_tl:dr: We recommend macOS._

You can use the operating system you like. But we recommend to use macOS because you might have some issues with other operating systems.

**Known issues:**
* Golden tests are only passing with macOS
* The Sharezone CLI (used for development) only officially supports macOS and Windows (should also work with other operating systems, but might cause problems in some cases)

If you discover unknown issues which are related to the operating system, please submit a new ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/SharezoneApp/sharezone-app/issues/new/choose).

### IDE
_tl:dr: We recommend VS Code._

Flutter supports IDE support for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). We support only VS Code. This doesn't mean you can't use other IDEs like Android Studio. But you might need set up more configuration steps which aren't documented by us (like launch configurations).

We added some files of the `.vscode` folder to this repository. This ensures that all VS Code users have the same VS Code settings (like formatting, launch configurations, etc.) for this repository.

### Flutter
Our client uses the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework. In order to run tests, compile the app, etc. you need to setup Flutter.

Please follow the official documentation: [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
