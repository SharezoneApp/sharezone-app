# This file is the "source of truth" for running commands that are the same for all operating systems.
# We want to run the same command everywhere, on local dev machines and on CI systems.
# Since Sharezone can be developed on Linux / Mac / Windows just putting the command in a a .sh file isn't enough, since Windows couldn't execute it.
# 
# CI:
# When running these commands via CI we just read them in inside the bash script and execute the command.
# This saves us first installing Dart for e.g. just executing a simple go script.
#
# Sharezone CLI:
# When running these commands via the Sharezone CLI we also read the command string from below and execute the command.
# In this case we can use Dart since it will be installed anyways.
# As bash will not be installed on a Windows machine we can't use the bash script used by the CI.

# There might very well be a better way to do this.

# Note: The directory at the end of the command is missing.
# The programs using these commands need to add it themselves.
